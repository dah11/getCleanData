The variables from the output come from the data obtained from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

To obtain variables by subject and activity the subject, activity, and train/test datasets were merged.
Then only measurements on the mean and standard deviation were kept.
Then all variables were averaged by subject,activity.
